CheckUp Manager 1.0 developed by Nishant Baranwal Somy (Roll. 12126) and 
Sagar Kowe (Roll. 12130) of class XII 'A' of year 2013, Kendriya Vidyalaya
IIT Powai. This software is not protected by any copyrights and any 
able-minded developer should feel free to use/modify the source code as 
they see fit as long as they give some credit to the original creators of 
the code.

Usage : First time users will be asked to initialize a password called 
AuthCode. DO NOT LOOSE THIS AUTHCODE. Program will hold records 
of Doctors (users), Patients (Clients) and Checkups (done by Doctors
for Patients). These records can be easily viewed. Please use with care
and do not press [ENTER] while entering quantity of medicine during checkups. 
It tends to screw up the program and we do not have the willpower/time
to fix it right now.

Thank you for choosing Checkup Manager 1.0
